# Usage 

So, there is actually not much you will need to do to set this script up for yourslef.
All you need to do is 

  1. Turn off raw input in controls/mouse settings
  2. Equip yor axe in hotbar slot 1
  3. At least 1 lectern in hotbar slot 2

Once you have done this, ensure you are standing in the centre of the block in front of the villegar (as shown in the video), and have at least 4 ish blocks of space 
behind where your standing.
